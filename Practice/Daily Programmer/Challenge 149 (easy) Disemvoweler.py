"""Disemvoweling means removing the vowels from text. (For this challenge,
the letters a, e, i, o, and u are considered vowels, and the letter y is not.) The idea is to make text
difficult but not impossible to read, for when somebody posts something so idiotic you want people who are
reading it to get extra frustrated.
To make things even harder to read, we'll remove spaces too. For example, this string:
two drums and a cymbal fall off a cliff
can be disemvoweled to get:
twdrmsndcymblfllffclff
We also want to keep the vowels we removed around (in their original order), which in this case is:
ouaaaaoai"""
